        <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
        <p class="formula"><span>ax + b = 0</span></p>
        <p>where <span class="variable">a</span> and <span class="variable">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="variable">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="variable">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="variable">x</span> there.</p>
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
        <p class="formula"><span>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></p>
        <p>where <span class="variable">a</span>, <span class="variable">b</span>, <span class="variable">c</span> are known values and <span class="variable">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="variable">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
        <p><span class="variable">&#960;</span> (<span class="variable_in_text">Pi</span>) times the radius (<span class="variable">r</span>) squared:</p>
        <p class="formula"><span>A = &#960; &#215; r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="variable">D</span>):</p>
        <p class="formula"><span>A = (&#960; / 4) &#215; D<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="variable">C</span>):</p>
        <p class="formula"><span>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215; &#960;</span></p>
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="variable">A</span> and <span class="variable">B</span>, denoted by A &#8745; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
        <p class="formula"><span>A 	&#8745; B = { x : x &#8712; A and x &#8712; B }</span></p>
        <p>That is, <span class="variable">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and only if x is both an element of <span class="variable">A</span> and an element of <span class="variable">B</span>.</p>
